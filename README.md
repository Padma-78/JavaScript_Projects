## Overview

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! This collection showcases a variety of projects that I have developed using JavaScript, demonstrating my skills in web development, problem-solving, and user interface design. Each project is designed to be functional, user-friendly, and a reflection of current web technologies.

## Projects

Hereâ€™s an overview of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. BMI Calculator
The BMI Calculator allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their Body Mass Index. The application provides immediate feedback on whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the calculated BMI value. This project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic calculations.

### 2. Background Color Changer
This simple yet engaging project enables users to change the background color of the webpage with a click of a button. Users can choose from a predefined color palette or generate random colors. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

### 3. Hangman Game
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where users attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This project features an interactive UI, including graphics that represent the hangman as incorrect guesses accumulate. It showcases my ability to implement game logic and user interaction.

### 4. Image Resizer
The Image Resizer allows users to upload an image and resize it according to their specifications. Users can adjust the dimensions and download the resized image directly from the browser. This project involves file handling and canvas manipulation in JavaScript.

### 5. Password Validation Check
This tool helps users create strong passwords by checking their input against various criteria such as length, use of special characters, and mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. The application provides real-time feedback on password strength, enhancing user security awareness.

### 6. Playable Piano
The Playable Piano project creates an interactive piano interface where users can play notes by clicking on piano keys or using their keyboard. This project combines sound synthesis with event listeners to create an engaging musical experience.

### 7. QR Generator
The QR Generator allows users to create QR codes from any text input or URL. Users can customize the size and error correction level of the generated QR code. This project demonstrates my understanding of external libraries for generating QR codes dynamically.

### 8. QR Code Reader
Complementing the QR Generator, this application enables users to scan QR codes using their device's camera or upload an image containing a QR code for decoding. It highlights my skills in integrating APIs and handling multimedia inputs.

### 9. Random Quote Generator
The Random Quote Generator presents users with a new motivational quote each time they click a button. Users can also share quotes on social media platforms directly from the application. This project emphasizes API integration and asynchronous programming with JavaScript.

### 10. Task Scheduler
This Task Scheduler helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently by allowing them to add, edit, and delete tasks from a list. Users can also mark tasks as completed. The application uses local storage to persist data across sessions, demonstrating my skills in state management.

### 11. Tic Tac Toe
The Tic Tac Toe game is a two-player game that allows users to compete against each other on a grid-based interface. The application checks for winning combinations and provides feedback on the game's outcome. This project showcases my ability to implement game logic and user interaction effectively.
